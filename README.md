Started learning C++ three weeks ago, decided to create some project.

```javascript
fn fib: n {
    return
        if (n < 2) n
        else fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
}
let result = fib(25)
disp "result of fib " _ result
```

Though this isnt as fast or efficient as my 2-year old Java interpreter implementation, it was a good learning project.
<br> Any code review from C++ devs is highly appreciated :)
